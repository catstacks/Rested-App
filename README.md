# Rested App Overview
The Rested App has been created for the QA bootcamp practical project. 

## Rested App Proposed Features (M = main feature, A = adventurous personal stretch-goal feature)
- Track daily sleep data (collected using timers). M
- Track daily screen time (user inputted data). M
- Track water consumption, users can set personal limits on intake before bed. A
- Produce weekly reports of user data, including total hours slept and average sleep quality rating (app generated data). M
- Rate sleep quality and make records in dreams journal (user inputted data). M
- Cat Nap vs Night Mode. A
- Cat Nap mode enters a sleep mode for 25 minutes (using timer/alarm integration), app records and adds all Cat Naps to weekly report
- Night Mode records expected majority of user's sleep (daily sleep = tracked sleep using timer - total user absences (minutes) from the night mode)
- Integration with music and podcast streaming services (spotify/apple music integration). A

## UML diagrams

> **From Stack Edit:** https://stackedit.io/app#
You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
